Power BI Project
Welcome to my Power BI Data Analytics project repository! Here, I am excited to share the insights and interactive dashboard I created during my Power BI course. I had the privilege of working on a practical project during the course, where I used real-like data to build a comprehensive dashboard. This hands-on experience allowed me to understand the true potential of Power BI and how it can empower businesses to make data-driven decisions. This project showcases various analyses, including net sales, gross margin, net profit by market (country), region, and customer level, along with top/bottom performers and key performance indicators (KPIs).
